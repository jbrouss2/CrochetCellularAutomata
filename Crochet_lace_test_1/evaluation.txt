Score 3 out of 10
Pattern Generator works, but hdc should be changed to dc for a nicer look.
A newline should be printed after each row for a more readable pattern.
I crocheted the first 13 rows generated by the large 28 by 28 cellular automata, and it does not look very impressive.
I think I need to try a smaller cellular automata that makes one cohesive small design, and then repeat that design to
get a better looking crochet lace. 
I also think for a more open looking lace, I should swap the current logic and make the ones or zeroes the ch stitches based on which one has more.
